In essence, SafeArt is a project focused on the use of innovative technologies; our
business aims to develop a direct connection between cryptocurrencies and the art
industry.


The SafeArt.io is a new platform based on the release of NFT collections, where
community comes first. The SafeArt.io community utility token is used to give liquidity to
the project and to interact on the platform itself.

We, the creators of SafeArt.io, strongly believe that the future of art is digital, both for
new works and for those created by the greatest artists of the past, those who have
made the history of art. Art is the expression of the human being itself. It is our duty as
human beings to preserve and cherish works of art by digitizing them and making them
immortal on the Blockchain.

We do not know what awaits us in the future, climate change and other factors are
putting a strain on our species and all existing artistic creations. This may get even worse
as time goes on, so saving art is our duty.
That's why the SafeArt.io community will make its contribution to this mission.
